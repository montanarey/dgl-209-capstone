## About Plant Parents
Plant Parents is a houseplant enthusiastâ€™s web resource for being the best plant parent they can be. The site will help users learn about their plants' specific needs and traits, as well as allow them to create a digital catalog of their plant family.

*Note: Plant Parents is a ficticious product that may be developed at a later date.*


## About the Design System
For this capstone project, I designed and developed a functional Design System for Plant Parents. The Design System is accompanied by a [Codepen collection of code snippets](https://github.com/montanarey/dgl-209-capstone).

### Purpose
This design system is intended to be used in the future development of Plant Parents, to provide a template for all UI elements and ensure style consistency.
 
### Content
The Design System consists of 12 sections, as well as an example site which displays all elements in context. The sections are as follows:

**Styles:**
* Colours
* Images
* Spacing
* Typography

**Navigation:**
* Breadcrumbs
* Buttons
* Navbars
* Submenus

**Components:**
* Avatars
* Cards
* Forms
* Lists

### Development
This project is currently in development. Languages used include HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Code snippets have also been made available for each element using CodePen.
